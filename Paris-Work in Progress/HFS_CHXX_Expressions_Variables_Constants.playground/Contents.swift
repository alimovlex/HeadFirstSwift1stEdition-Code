//modulo/remainder operator

// these are all expressions (each line), which means they have a value
// look to the results sidebar (right) so see what the value of the expressions is once they have been execute

// shift+enter to run the playground again
// you can't mix whitespace styles

//try using decimal numbers
11/7
11.0/7.0

// maybe cover: truncatingRemainder, showing using this with decimal numbers

// Shift operations
// binary lesson

1<<3
32>>2
// both equal 8

// why use shifts?
// makes multiplying or dividing easier when doing by powers of two
// shiftiing left by one is same as multiplying by two
// shifting left by two is the same as multiplying by four
// shifting right by one is the same as dividing by two
// shifting right by two is the same as dividing by four

// HISTORY LESSON: shifting is simpler for a CPU than actual muliplication
// less relevant now
// but useful to know

// Order of Operations
// Operator Precedence
// same as school!

// MATHS!
// add the import UIKit back!
